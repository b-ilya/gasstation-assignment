# N-iXtest
Test for N-iX

## Task description
Hi! 

We're glad that you decided to take the test. Here you can find a few instructions and tips.
### GOAL 
The goal is to implement the interface of a gas station which has multiple gas pumps. Each gas pump provides a specific amount of gas of a certain gas type. Refer to the interface and comments as to how gas stations are added and how the interface is supposed to be used. 
### SCENARIO 
Customers will be requesting gas with different requirements regarding the amount, type of gas and price they are willing to pay for it. Your implementation has to take all this into account and serve gas when available. For further information please refer to the documentation of our classes. Take special care to take efficient multithreading into account as multiple threads (customers) will be accessing the GasStation in parallel. 
### TECHNICAL INSTRUCTIONS 
The zip-file attached to the mail contains a maven-module which you can import into your IDE (tested with Eclipse). Please create your own module and add our module as dependency. It also contains files for gradle integration if you so prefer. It would be best to upload your work to GitHub frequently and give us access to it afterwards. 
### DELIVERABLE 
We expect you to provide a correctly working implementation of the GasStation interface along with appropriate unit tests. You are not required to implement anything else, you should not modify provided classes/interfaces and you may add any dependencies or supporting classes you think make sense. 

We hope you have fun with this task and are looking forward to your results!
